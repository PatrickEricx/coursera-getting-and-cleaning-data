Course:        Coursera - Data Science Track - 03.Data Cleaning
Exercise:      Project
Creation date: 25 oct 2015
------------------------------------------------------------------

The observations are people, here called subjects doing an action.
The Variables are all the other columns derived from sensor measurements.

Repeatable steps:
1) downloadZip.R 
   This will download and unzip the zip from the url specified in the Project into a local folder on your disk.
2) mergeDataSets.R
   The datasets test and train are merged.
   dependency on package stringr
   In the beginning I did not knew that the "Inertial Signals" folder was not required, so the initial attempt was a solution to merge all the files, based on their filenames.   
   Output: 
   3 txt files are created
   X.txt
   subject.txt
   y.txt
3) I copied features.txt from the source data in Excel for some analysis, to see if we should keep all "mean" functions.
   This was inspired by this blogpost:  https://thoughtfulbloke.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/getting-and-cleaning-the-assignment/
   The excel to filter out some mean columns is also in this project.
   I excluded meanfreq, because mean frequency is not a mean.
   It is very unlikely that electronic devices will use the arithmetic mean, so we can not conclude that these angle function "averages" must be included in our "mean value" dataset.
  extra argument: 
Standard deviation is directly related to mean, but none of the excluded "mean" variables has a related "std" variable. All the other "mean" variables do have an "std" variable that immediately follows them.
  The functions that have KEEP = Y in the last column, are exported to columnsToKeep.csv
   This csv is then used to filter out only the required columns.
   
4) run_analysis.R
  # These questions are solved by this script, in this order:
  # Question 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  # Question 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  # Question 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  # Question 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  dependency: 
  plyr
  dplyr
  they must be loaded in this order.
  output: tidydatasetWithoutRowNames.txt

Output:
tidy dataset.  
We first group by subject, and then by activity, then we see clearly that 
* some people do more then one activity.  
* we have measurements for all 30 people.
I can not explain what the average from an average or the average from an standard deviation would mean, but it was just the requirement to calculate the mean of these columns.
All the other columns represents a calculated variable, based on a different measurement.
 
 
You can read it back in with this command:
table.read(file = "mergedDataSets/tidydatasetWithoutRowNames.txt", row.names = FALSE )
 
 Test to see if the data was correctly retrieved from disk, after filtering the columns (Question 2)
